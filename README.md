## 🌸 **Flower Classification using CNN (Streamlit + Keras)** 🚀

---

### **Project Overview**

This project implements a deep learning-based flower classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system allows users to upload a flower image and identifies its category in real time through a simple and interactive Streamlit web application. This project addresses the need for accessible, efficient, and accurate image classification tools in the domain of botany, research, and education.

### **Technology & Methodology** 🧠

#### 🧾 **Image Preprocessing & Model Training**

* **Dataset**: The model is trained on a labeled flower dataset containing five categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.
* **Preprocessing**: All images are resized to 180x180 pixels and normalized to ensure consistent input to the CNN model.
* **Architecture**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and trained using TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high classification accuracy.

#### 🔍 **Prediction Pipeline**

* **Image Input**: The user uploads an image via a browser-based interface powered by **Streamlit**.
* **Classification**: The model processes the image and outputs the predicted flower category along with a confidence score.
* **Softmax Output**: Predictions are normalized using a softmax layer, returning the probability distribution across classes.
